      <h4>Scope of the Program</h4>
      <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>
        This program is specifically designed for our websites and applications. We prioritize the detection and prevention of incidents that may lead to:

        - Direct unauthorized access to or draining of locked user funds.
        - Social engineering attacks that could result in users inadvertently authorizing transactions or being redirected to malicious sites.
